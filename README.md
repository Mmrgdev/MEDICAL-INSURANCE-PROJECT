### MEDICAL INSURANCE PROJECT

#### Investigation of a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using Python.

##### We will analyze various attributes within insurance.csv to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset.

###### We will calculate:

* Calculate the average ages of the patients in insurance.csv
* Calculate the number of males and females in insurance.csv
* Determine each unique region patients are from
* Calculate the average yearly medical charges for patients in insurance.csv
* Creating a dictionary that contains all patient information
